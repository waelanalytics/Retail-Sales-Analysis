# End-to-End Retail Sales Analysis Project

This project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow, starting from raw data cleaning to building an interactive dashboard. I analyzed over 400,000 sales records to identify key business insights.

## 🚀 Business Questions
This analysis aimed to answer three core business questions:
1.  **Where** are our key markets geographically?
2.  **Who** are our most valuable (VIP) customers?
3.  **When** do our sales peak throughout the year?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
*   **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Python (Pandas, Jupyter)
*   **Data Storage & Analysis:** SQL (MySQL)
*   **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI

## 📊 Key Insights & Dashboard
The final result is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the following key insights:

1.  **UK Market Dominance:** The UK accounts for over 80% of total revenue, highlighting its critical importance.
2.  **High-Value Customer Segments:** A small group of VIP customers contributes a significant portion of the revenue.
3.  **Seasonal Sales Peak:** Sales show a massive spike in the final quarter of the year, peaking in November.
